## Swift:

- [ ] Use and understand Swift's basic types like Bool, Int, String, and Double
- [ ] Declare and use variables and constants
- [ ] Handle flow control and looping constructs
- [ ] Create and use collections 


## Int

Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component, they are either signed (positive, zero, or negative) or unsigned (positive or zero).

```Swift
let aInt: Int = 1
let anotherInt = 1
let oneMillion = 1_000_000
```

## Floating Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers with a fractional component.

Double has a precision of at least 15 decimal digits, whereas the precision of Float can be as little as 6 decimal digits.
The appropriate floating-point type to use depends on the nature and range of values you need to work with in your code.
In situations where either type would be appropriate, Double is preferred.

```Swift
let aDouble: Double = 0.1
let anotherDouble = 0.1
```

## Bool

```Swift
let aBool: Bool = true
```

## String

```Swift
let aString: String = "String"
```
